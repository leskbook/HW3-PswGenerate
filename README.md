This application generates a random password based on user input and prompted inclusive criteria. Javascript was used to provide the confirmation input as well as the prompted input. Javascript was also used to validate prompted input. 



Application criteria

Length of password - the user is prompted to input a number between 8 and 128. Validation requires that the number can't be omitted as well as a second validation for length. This is accomplished through a javascript if else if condition. 

The user is then presented with an OK or Cancel to stipulate the additional password criteria. 

The application generates the random password after all of the selection criteria is complete. 

I have changed the button color from the original markup just to add a little punch. 

Using javascript arrays enables the creation of random numbers, letters and symbols.
