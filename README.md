This application generates a random password based on user input and prompted inclusive criteria. Javascript was used to provide the confirmation input as well as the prompted input. Javascript was also used to validate prompted input. 



Application criteria

Length of password - the user is prompted to input a number between 8 and 128. Validation requires that the number can't be omitted as well as a second validation for length





The end result of the application provides the user a new and secure password. Without a set of prompts, the user would not be able to follow any directions towards generating a new password.

This repository cemented the concepts of Javascript and how logic plays a key role within software development. By not confining a user within a set of boundaries and guidelines, the application would be open for interpretation and might not prompt the user towards a specific action or goal.
